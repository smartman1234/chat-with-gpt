# About Chat with GPT

Chat with GPT is an open-source, unofficial ChatGPT app with extra features and more ways to customize your experience.

ChatGPT is an AI assistant developed by OpenAI. It's designed to understand natural language and generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and prompts. ChatGPT has been trained on a massive dataset of text from the internet, which allows it to draw on a vast amount of knowledge and information to answer questions and engage in conversation. ChatGPT is constantly being improved. Feel free to ask it anything!
